# Predicting loan defaults for LTFS India

## Objective
Financial institutions have incurred significant losses due to vehicle loans defaults. This has led to the restriction of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates.  A financial institution has hired you to help improve their credit scoring model by predicting the occurrence of vehicle loan defaults. 

The data was provided by LTFS India during a [machine learning hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/ltfs-datascience-finhack-an-online-hackathon/).
