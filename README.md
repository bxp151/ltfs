2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt `
3. Open `housing.py` and set `HOME_DIR` to the directory path where you cloned the repository
4. In `housing.py`, I commented out the `Execute target shuffling` code block starting on `line 453` because it takes several hours to run.  The results of the execution will be loaded automatically into the gb_scores variable.
